Links bible-references in posts automatically to the appropriate bible-verse(s) at bibleserver.com.

== Description ==

Link To Bible links any bible reference (e.g. "Genesis 20:1" (en) or "Lukas 5,3" (de)) you write in a post automatically to the appropriate bible verse(s) at bibleserver.com.

You can hereby choose from many different bible versions in different languages. (See http://www.bibleserver.com/webmasters/index.php for all availabe languages and bible versions.)

Bibleserver.com detects language specific the most common notations of bible references.

= Notes =
- This plugin uses the webservice of bibleserver.com
- The links to bibleserver.com are added while saving a post, because the requests to bibleserver.com are limited per day and site. For posts created before activating 'Link-To-Bible' and never saved since then, the links to bibleserver.com are added when the post is viewed the first time.  
- Changing an already linked bible reference (e.g. "Gen 1,2" -> "Gen 2,1"), saving the post will automatically update the link to bibleserver.com.

= Privacy =
The following information is transmitted to bibleserver.com to add the links:<ul>
<li>Your API-Key</li>
<li>The URL of your blog</li>
<li>The selected bible version</li>
<li>The text of your post including all markups (and may be content or markup added by other plugins or themes)</li>
<li>The version of this plugin, the version of your wordpress installation and the php version running your wordpress installation</li>
</ul>

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I disable the linking of a bible-reference? =
You can mark any text with the css-class 'nolink' to avoid linking it to bibleserver.com; e.g. <code><span class="nolink">Mt 2,10 or Gen 5,11 will not be linked to bibleserver.com</span></code>.
To disable the linking of a whole post, just add the metadata 'LTB_DISABLE' to the post. (Adding 'LTB_DISABLE' to an existing post with existing links to bibleserver.com will not remove these existing links.)

= Can I set the bible version per post? =
Yes. You can set the bible version using the metadata of a post with 'LTB_BIBLE_VERSION' and the abbreviation codes from bibleserver.com (http://www.bibleserver.com/webmasters/), e.g. set the metadata LTB_BIBLE_VERSION=KJV to use the 'King James Version' for this post. 

= I have a question / The plugin does not work for me / I have a feature request ... =
If you have any issues with the plugin, please write to mail@thomas-kuhlmann.de (german or english).
